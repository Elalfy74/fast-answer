  'The main function is a special case. I\'\'ll get back to it.\nMore generally, (almost) every C++ function has a return type. A simple example:\nint plus1(int n) {\n    return n + 1;\n}\n\nThe return type is int, meaning that a call to plus is an expression of type int. The value is returned to the caller, which is going to be an expression.\nFor example:\nprintf("%d\n", plus1(42));\n\nacts like:\nprintf("%d\n", 43);\n\nThe returned value is passed as an argument to the printf function -- whose own return value can be used by its caller.\nmain is the function that\'\'s invoked when your program starts running. There is no explicit "caller". But main returns an int value that\'\'s communicated to the execution environment.\nThe language could have defined two separate constructs, one for a chunk of code that returns a value to a caller within the program, and one for a chunk of code that returns a value to the execution environment, but they\'\'re sufficiently similar that C and C++ use "function" for both.\n',
  'To create a 3-item carousel effect, we define five possible states for our slide:\n\nlhidden (hidden on the leftmost side)\nlqueue (in queue on the left side)\nactive (the currently active slide)\nrqueue (in queue on the right side)\nrhidden (hidden on the rightmost side)\n\nThe styling for these five states makes use of CSS opacity, z-index, and transform properties.\n.slide.active {\n  opacity: 1;\n  z-index: 2;\n  transform: translate(0px) scale(1);\n}\n\n.slide.lqueue {\n  opacity: 0.64;\n  z-index: 1;\n  transform: translate(-100%) scale(0.64);\n}\n\n.slide.rqueue {\n  opacity: 0.64;\n  z-index: 1;\n  transform: translate(100%) scale(0.64);\n}\n\n.slide.lhidden {\n  opacity: 0;\n  z-index: auto;\n  transform: translate(-160%) scale(0);\n}\n\n.slide.rhidden {\n  opacity: 0;\n  z-index: auto;\n  transform: translate(160%) scale(0);\n}\n\nTo place the list gallery in center of the container, we use flex display on container and set its align-center and justify-content to center. Then, to make so that each item in the list is stacked on top of each other in the same place, we set relative position on the list, and absolute position on each item, with top margin equal to 0.\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n..gallery {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 400px; /* Can be anything */\n  height: 650px; /* Can be anything */\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.slide {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\nIn the JavaScript, we iterate over each slide and set add rhidden to their class list. After which, we manually set the first slide to have active and the second slide to have rqueue class respectively. Then, we attach an event listener to the click event on each slide, passing its index as argument, so that we can manipulate its immediate siblings to achieve the carousel effect.\nfunction initializeCarousel(){\n  const slides = document.querySelectorAll(".slide");\n  for (let index = 0;

  "The code you are seeing in the debugger is not the code being executed. What you see as Container.tsx is actually probably just a snippet of compiled pure JS in a huge bundle.js somewhere.\nTypescript code requires compilation before the browser can read it. As part of this step, it also generates source maps which map the compiled code back to your original source files. Webpack or whatever bundler you''re using probably does it''s own compilation then, and makes new source maps.\nFor the most part this makes it easier to debug, but it isn't perfect. So what you think is DialogTitle probably is an identifier that got transformed somehow during compilation, minification, obfuscation, bundling, etc...\nYou can disable source maps entirely to get a clearer view if what''s going on, though the code your debugging will probably start to look pretty cryptic.\nSource maps usually do work just fine, but not all tools can generate them perfectly, I''ve observed.\n\nAs for how the switch statement works, functions have an identity which can be queried by a switch statement.\nFor example, this works because MyComponent is assigned either A or B and each case  can test that.\nfunction A() { return <>A</> }\nfunction B() { return <>B</> }\n\nconst MyComponent = Math.random() > 0.5 ? A : B\n\nswitch(MyComponent) {\n  case A: console.log(''got A''); break\n  case B: console.log(''got B''); break\n}\n// logs \"got A\" or \"got B\"\n\nSee playground\n\n\nIn the code I referenced, it''s switch(child.type) and I don't understand how child.type is compared against a function? child.type is itself a function, but I''m still very confused about how that comparison evaluates to true.\n\nThis delves into react internals a bit, so I can't vouch for why but this appears to be what''s going on.\nWhen a component is rendered it returns a JSX.Element object. This object appears to have a type property on it that is a reference to the component that rendered that JSX.\nFor example:\nfunction A() { return <>A</> }\nconsole.log(<A />);\n\nYields this in the console:\n\nThis means that rendered JSX remembers the component that rendered it via that type property. And this loop here checks to see if any children were rendered with specific components that may need special handling.\nHere''s a minimal example that''s closer to what your original snippet is actually doing.",

You can see the difference using the in operator:\n"0" in new Array(3); // false\n"0" in [undefined, undefined, undefined]; // true\n\nThis stems from the slightly confusing fact that if you try to get the value of a non-existent property of any native object in JavaScript, it returns undefined (rather than throwing an error, as happens when you try to refer to a non-existent variable), which is the same as what you get if the property has previously been explictly set to undefined.',

  "I think the best way to explain this is to look at the way that Chrome handles it.  \n>>> x = new Array(3)\n[]\n>>> x.length\n3\n\nSo what is actually happening is that new Array() is returning an empty array that has a length of 3, but no values. Therefore, when you run x.map on a technically empty array, there is nothing to be set. \nFirefox just 'fills i' those empty slots with undefined even though it has no values.\nI don''t think this is explicitly a bug, just a poor way of representing what is going on. I suppose Chrome''s is \"more correct\" because it shows that there isn''t actually anything in the array.",
  "Not a bug.  That''s how the Array constructor is defined to work.\nFrom MDC:\n\nWhen you specify a single numeric parameter with the Array constructor, you specify the initial length of the array. The following code creates an array of five elements:\n\nvar billingMethod = new Array(5);\n\n\nThe behavior of the Array constructor depends on whether the single parameter is a number.\n\nThe .map() method only includes in the iteration elements of the array that have explicitly had values assigned. Even an explicit assignment of undefined will cause a value to be considered eligible for inclusion in the iteration. That seems odd, but it''s essentially the difference between an explicit undefined property on an object and a missing property:\nvar x = { }, y = { z: undefined };\nif (x.z === y.z) // true\n\nThe object x does not have a property called \"z\", and the object y does. However, in both cases it appears that the \"value\" of the property is undefined. In an array, the situation is similar: the value of length does implicitly perform a value assignment to all the elements from zero through length - 1. The .map() function therefore won''t do anything (wonn''t call the callback) when called on an array newly constructed with the Array constructor and a numeric argument.",

  'Since the question is why, this has to do with how JS was designed.\nThere are 2 main reasons I can think of to explain this behavior:\n\nPerformance: Given x = 10000 and new Array(x) it is wise for the constructor to avoid looping from 0 to 10000 to fill the array with undefined values.\nImplicitly "undefined": Give a = [undefined, undefined] and b = new Array(2), a[1] and b[1] will both return undefined, but a[8] and b[8] will also return undefined even if they\'\'re out of range.\n\nUltimately, the notation empty x 3 is a shortcut to avoid setting and displaying a long list of undefined values that are undefined anyway because they are not declared explicitly.\nNote: Given array a = [0] and a[9] = 9, console.log(a) will return (10) [0, empty x 8, 9], filling the gap automatically by returning the difference between the two values declared explicitly.\n',
