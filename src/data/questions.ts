(to the caller or system)\nHow powerful and useful is a return value and who is his intel important to?\n',

    body: '\nGoal: To create a carousel effect when switching between items laid out in a list. Consider the following HTML structure:\n<div class="container">\n  <ul class="gallery">\n    <li class="slide">\n      <!-- Some content -->\n    </li>\n    <li class="slide">\n      <!-- Some content -->\n    </li>\n    <!-- Some more items -->\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\nInitially, the list gallery should be centered inside the container, with each list item slide stacked on top of each other. After populating the slides with relevant data, the first slide should be made active, while the second slide be scaled a bit smaller and less opaque (among other styling that shows that this slide is not active, but in queue). All the other slides should be hidden.\nNow, clicking on any item (slide) - except for the active one - should trigger the carousel effect, which looks similar to this implementation by GreenSock (The difference is that, first their implementation is dependent on scrolling through mouse-wheel, whereas, I want the effect to take place on clicking an item. Also, their implementation requires the use of third-party library GSAP and ScrollTrigger, but I do not want to use either of them - only plain DOM manipulation. Additionally, they have infinite scroll but I do not want to circle back to the other end when list is finished in either end.)\nNote: I have already written my own solution, which I will write below as an answer, but I will not mark it as accepted for some time (approx. 2 hours).\n',

For *, a total of 86 columns is obtained.\nAfterwards, I try to iterate through these results in Java. The problem is, because this query return so many results, it ends up taking around half a GB of memory of my JVM and, sometimes, ends up throwing OutOfMemoryError.\nA simple solution to this would be to increase JVM is memory with -Xms and/or -Xmx. But this would not be ideal. What if, in the future, this query ends up returning even more results, leading me to do this again? Also, iterating through all of these results, when it works, takes a long time too (almost 10 seconds).\nIs there any way I can go about optimizing this to return less results or handle them in a better way? The problem is a lot of results are duplicated and I am not interested in that. For example, I want the 294 rows of both t2 and t3, but I don''t care about the 86436 rows the two combined return.\nEDIT:\nFor my code in Java, I am using Vert''x JDBCClient. I use the method queryWithParams to execute my SQL query, which returns a ResultSet. Afterwards, all I do is call its getRows() method to get all my results as a List<JsonObject>. In this method, it has to iterate through all the rows to clone them as JsonObject. This is where the problem happens. Here is a basic example:\nvar client = JDBCClient.createShared(vertx, config);\nvar query = \"SELECT .....\";\nvar params = new JsonArray();\n\nclient.queryWithParams(query, params, result -> result.result().getRows());\n\nAs for my DB driver configuration, I use Vert''x HikariCPDataSourceProvider, which uses the default configurations from com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig.\n",

I managed to make a program that recognizes the keyboard and print the letter, however, it prints the letter more than once, depending on the key it generates more than two (for example printscreen key and delete). I suspect that it might be the keyboard buffer, already tried to clean it but without any success. My code right now is that one:\n.code16\n.text\n.globl _start;\n\n_start:\n    # prints \"X\" -> Just to know that the application started\n    movb $''X'' , %al\n    movb $0x0e, %ah\n    int  $0x10\n\n    # Ensure we are starting from the beginning of the interrupt vector\n    movw $0x0, %ax          # Putting the value 0 in ax to store in Data Segment Register (ds)\n    movw %ax, %ds           # Putting 0 in Data Segment Register(ds)\n    movw $0x204,%bx         # Going to address 0x204 -> 512 in the interruput vector  200 <- 80 * 4bytes, 204 <- 200 + 4bytes\n    movw $0x7d00, (%bx)     # Putting the address 0x7d00 in the %bx addres, 0x7d00 = = _start addres + 256\n\n    # First PIC (master)\n    movb $0x11, %al\n    outb  %al, $0x20  # Sending ICW1 in the first PIC -> 0001 0001: ICW4 is required\n    movb $0x80, %al\n    outb  %al, $0x21  # Sending ICW2 in the first PIC -> 1000 0000: defines the interrupt that will be called (80)\n    movb $0x04, %al\n    outb  %al, $0x21  # Sending ICW3 in the first PIC -> 0000 0100: has a skave\n    movb $0x01, %al\n    outb  %al, $0x21  # Sending ICW4 in the first PIC -> 0000 0001: 8086/8088 mode\n    movb $0xfd, %al\n    outb %al, $0x21   # Inhibiting all interrupts except keyboard (OCW1)\n\n    # Second PIC (slave)\n    movb $0x11, %al\n    outb  %al, $0xa0  # Sending ICW1 in the second PIC -> 0001 0001: ICW4 is required\n    movb $0x80, %al\n    outb  %al, $0xa1  # Sending ICW2 in the second PIC -> 1000 0000: defines the interrupt that will be called (80)\n    movb $0x02, %al\n    outb  %al, $0xa1  # Sending ICW3 in the second PIC -> 0000 0010:\n    movb $0x01, %al\n    outb  %al, $0xa1  # Sending ICW4 in the second PIC -> 0000 0001: 8086/8088 mode\n    movb $0xff, %al\n    outb %al, $0xa1   # Inibindo todas as interrupcoes, exceto teclado (OCW1)\n\n    movb $0xfd, %al     # Sending OCW1 in the first PIC\n    outb %al, $0x21\n    movb $0xff, %al     # Sending OCW1 in the second PIC\n    outb %al, $0xa1\n\n\n    # Loop to get interrupt\n    mov $0x0, %cl\n_loop:          #infinity loop\n    cmp $0x0, %cl\n    je _loop\n    hlt\nintKBD:\n    . = _start + 256\n\n    movb $0x20, %al    # Sending OCW2 in the first PIC -> EOI\n    outb %al, $0x20\n\n.checkKeyboard:\n    in $0x64, %al\n    and $0x1, %al\n    jz .emptyKeyboard\n    in $0x60, %al\n    jmp .fullKeyboard\n\n    #If keyboard is mepty -> Prints V\n.emptyKeyboard:\n    movb $'V', %al\n    movb $0x0e, %ah\n    int $0x10\n\n    #If keyboard is full -> Prints K\n.fullKeyboard:\n    movb $'K', %al\n    movb $0x0e, %ah\n    int $0x10\n    iret\n\n_end:   #Signature boot\n    . = _start + 510\n        .byte 0x55\n        .byte 0xaa\n\nAny piece of code or directions are very appreciated\n",
